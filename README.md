# LIBRARY
![Top Page Screenshot](./screenshot.png)
Library developed in Javascript where you can add new books, remove the books created and change the status of the book, from read to not read.


## About the Project

The original specification of the project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

We implemented a library that saves the information in the localStorage using JavaScript.

If you click the 'Add new book' button, you can create a new book with the following information:
- Title
- Author
- Number of pages
- Status: If you have read the book or not.

After creating the book, you can:
- Remove it from your library using the remove button.
- Change the status to read or unread using the change status button.
